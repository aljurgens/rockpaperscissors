## Project: Rock Paper Scissors
From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors)

Created a simple JavaScript "Rock Paper Scissors" game that runs in the browser. The user picks from a rock, paper, or scissors and a random choice of the same is generated for the computer. The game then posts the winner (or tie) to the page. It also keeps track of the number of wins and losses of each player, and allows the user to reset the game in the browser.
