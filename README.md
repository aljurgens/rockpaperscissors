## Project: Rock Paper Scissors
From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors)

Created a simple 5-round JavaScript "Rock Paper Scissors" game that takes place in the console. The game prompts the user for their selection of rock, paper, or scissors and generates a random choice for the computer's selection. It posts the winner (or tie) to the console. It also handles bad user input (or null input) with a "Error in user selection" message. However, it still increments the number of rounds in the game after a bad entry.
